# Plutus

NYP students' year 3 project (not FYPJ) - Smart Device Development & Project. 

## Problem Statement

There is a wide range of payment systems in the world today and it is hard to keep track of oneâ€™s spending and budgeting on multiple payment platforms (PayPal, visa, master, etc.). It is also hard to track the use of cash, spendings, savings, current solutions are not viable as it is a hassle to manually enter every cash transaction.

## Solution
A centralised monetary system that incorporates the transaction of money, tracking of spending, budgeting and savings. So basically a E-wallet app.

## Getting Started

You will need a Mac, Macbook or a Hackintosh emulator.

### Prerequisites

pod install when you download or clone the file for the first time

```
pod install
```
